# UW-Bootcamp-Portfolio

## User Stories (MVP)

- UW-Bootcamp_portfolio is my first homework assignment/project at the UW Bootcamp. The objective of this project is to develop a porfolio to showcase my software development knowledge and skills, obtained during the first week and a half of my journey, to potential employers and clients. Several years ago I had taken  coding classes but had to postpone my completion due to family complications. Coding is definitely not like riding a bike, you need to practice and learn everyday to keep up with technology and to become a successful developer. While I enjoy the flexibility of my current research scientist job, my ultimate goal is to pivot out of academia and apply my passion for technology in a more relevant, challenging,  team-oriented and prosperous field. More importantly, I want to instill in my kids the necessity and value in setting higher goals and expectations for themselves, something learned a bit later than planned but now more ready than ever!

- In this project I learned the fundamentals of full-stack development including, but not limited to, HTML, CSS, Git & Git workflow, GitHub and command-line basics. Most recently we implemented bootstrap, a useful CSS framework providing quick and consistent styling to any project. Building and adding content to my portfolio was fairly straightforward, however, I did initially struggle with CSS features such as floats and positioning. I had to play around quite a bit with my CSS stylesheet to get the ideal, proper formatting for my project. With the introduction and application of bootstrap, web applications can easily become styled, organized and consistent which is not only important for your project but also for employers and clients.

- In my portfolio I built an HTML page and included title, body, header, headings, p-tags, links, divs, nav bar, container, form, input, images and footer. Within the divs and images I used classes (and one id) to provide specific styling to the associated tags. This styling was addressed in my CSS stylesheet which included attributes such as color, background-color, width, height, border, margin and padding. To render these attributes I included the CSS stylesheet to my HTML file. In addition I built, updated and saved my work to Github using git commands such as ls, cd .. , cd, mkdir, touch, git clone, git add -A, git commit -m, git pull, and git push.

- Last but not least, I've thoroughly enjoyed this re-cap of the introduction to coding which not only sparked my memory but also clarified concepts such as classes vs ids, CSS positioning, etc. I'm also excited to implement bootstrap, re-learn javascript and capture whatever my journey here at UW Bootcamp brings next!!
